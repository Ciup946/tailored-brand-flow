## Narrative

Jane is a marketing lead for an international SaaS provider. Her team creates tons of valuable resources in Notion but struggles with delivering the right piece to the right audience—especially as privacy regulations rise and cookie-based personalization becomes unreliable. With Vista, Jane connects her Notion workspace to the platform in minutes. She selects content relevant to specific audience pain points, customizes her website's appearance using the built-in style editor, and sets up a welcome flow where visitors can easily express their needs, all without intrusive tracking.

When a new visitor, Sam, lands on their Vista-powered product page, he's prompted with a simple "What are you looking to achieve today?" field. By stating his goals, Sam instantly sees resources most relevant to his interests—and can switch to his native language for clarity. The professional styling Jane selected ensures a consistent, branded experience. No forms, no third-party cookies, just guided discovery and value.

Jane now tracks exactly how each resource performs, iterates content based on real engagement data, updates her site's styling seasonally, and confidently reports ROI—all while respecting her users' privacy and boosting conversions for the business.
