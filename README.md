- **Real-time Analytics**: Performance tracking and engagement metrics
- **Rich Media Support**: Advanced handling of images, videos, and embeds including HEIC format

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Vista follows a modern JAMstack architecture:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase with PostgreSQL and pgvector for semantic search
- **AI Services**: OpenAI/VertexAI for embeddings and Google Translate for localization
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for media backup and CDN delivery

## üìã Documentation

### Core Documentation
- [**Product Requirements Document (PRD)**](./docs/PRD.md) - Complete product specification and requirements
- [**Sequence Diagrams**](./docs/SEQUENCE_DIAGRAMS.md) - Detailed system interaction flows
- [**Class Diagrams**](./docs/CLASS_DIAGRAMS.md) - System architecture and component relationships
- [**Development Guide**](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) - DTDD workflow and implementation guidelines

### Development Approach

This project follows **Document-driven Test-driven Development (DTDD)**:

1. **Documentation First**: All features are specified in detailed documentation
2. **Test-Driven**: Tests are written based on documented requirements
3. **Implementation**: Code is written to satisfy tests and documentation
4. **Iteration**: Continuous refinement based on feedback and testing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Supabase account
- Notion API access (optional, for content sync)
- OpenAI or VertexAI API key (for semantic search)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/vista.git
cd vista
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Configure your Supabase and API keys
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the database migrations from `supabase/migrations/`
3. Configure authentication providers
4. Set up storage buckets for media files

## üß™ Testing

Vista uses a comprehensive testing strategy:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test suite
npm run test -- --testNamePattern="Notion sync"
```

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility function testing
- **Integration Tests**: API and service integration testing  
- **E2E Tests**: Full user journey testing with Playwright

## üìä Key Metrics & Success Criteria

### Business Metrics
- **30% increase** in customer engagement rates
- **40% reduction** in content operations cost and time
- **80% of content** served with AI-based personalization
- **25% of visitors** sign up and declare preferences

### Technical Metrics
- **99.9% uptime** for content display
- **<2 seconds** average search response time
- **‚â§1% failure rate** for Notion synchronization

## üîí Privacy & Compliance

Vista is built with privacy-first principles:

- **No third-party tracking** or cookies
- **Explicit user consent** for all data collection
- **GDPR and CCPA compliant** from day one
- **Data minimization** - only collect what's explicitly provided
- **User control** over personalization preferences

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Adding New Features

1. **Update Documentation**: Add requirements to PRD and update sequence/class diagrams
2. **Write Tests**: Create tests based on documented behavior
3. **Implement**: Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Review**: Ensure compliance with documentation and test coverage
5. **Deploy**: Use staging environment for validation

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled
- **80%+ test coverage** required for new features
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Automated code quality and formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Quality gates before commits

## üö¢ Deployment

Vista supports multiple deployment options:

### Lovable Platform (Recommended)
- One-click deployment with built-in Supabase integration
- Automatic HTTPS and CDN configuration
- Environment variable management

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to your preferred platform
# (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
```
